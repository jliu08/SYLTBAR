<h2>Our Inspiration</h2>
<p>Along Germany's pristine northern shore lies an island that embodies elegance. The North Sea meets the finest sand on a 26 mile-long western beach while picturesque dunes and charming lighthouses characterize its idyllic landscape. This island is Sylt.</p>
<p>Natural beauty is boundless on Sylt with it&rsquo;s sun-kissed meadows, majestic cliffs, and the allure of the sea. Jet-setters, celebrities and travel aficionados from around the world covet the beauty of its sandy beaches and indulge in its sophisticated tranquility.</p>
<p>Dining on Sylt embodies the same natural elegance, from beach bistros to haute cuisine. Sylt&rsquo;s visitors truly experience 'la dolce vita' - the good life - from lounging on its gorgeous white, sandy beaches to enjoying the best in golf, polo, surfing, sailing, theater and the arts. Sylt is considered the Hamptons or Nantucket of Europe and embodies elegance in its truest form - yet with a style uniquely its own.</p>
