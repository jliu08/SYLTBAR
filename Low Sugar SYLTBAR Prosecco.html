<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Double Fermentation Process</h2>

<p>Our Premium SYLTBAR Sparkling products are naturally low in sugar and it all starts with the fermentation process, or rather, the double fermentation process. The grapes start in a thermal-controlled stainless steel tanks for 10 days where the fermentation turns the grapes into wine. Next, the wine moves to pressurized tanks for the 25-day sparkling process. This is where the process ends for many proseccos. The SYLBAR Premium Prosecco is held for another 60 days in stainless steel tanks, allowing the yeast to work their magic. This leaves only fruit sugar behind from the 100% Glera or 100% Merlot grapes which you&rsquo;ll taste immediately.</p>

<p>While many of our fans were quick to try our sparkling wine, we also had many skeptics. To address their concerns and get a scientific measurement of the sugar content in our Sparkling products, we enlisted the help of Dr. Camillo Ricordi at the University of Miami Diabetes Research Institute. The result? SYLTBAR has the lowest amount of glucose, only 166mg of Glucose per 100ml glass compared to an average of four times as much. The sugar content in SYLTBAR low enough for some diabetics to enjoy!</p>
