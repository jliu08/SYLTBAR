    <h2>SYLTBAR Sparkling</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3 style="color:#a4905e;">Why was SYLTBAR created?</h3>
            <p>SYLTBAR was created to bring consumers premium quality Prosecco at non-premium prices. There are so many different types of cheap Prosecco available right now that is filled with added sulfites - for extended shelf life and added sugar - for taste. SYLTBAR was created to give you a high-quality Prosecco that you can drink every day. There is no special occasion needed to enjoy SYLTBAR.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 style="color:#a4905e;">What’s the difference between the Prosecco and Sparkling Rosé?</h3>
            <p>SYLTBAR Prosecco is made from 100% Glera grapes and the Sparkling Rosé is made from 100% Merlot grapes. The type of grape used changes determines the resulting flavor of our sparkling products. <br><br> By Italian Law, Prosecco has to contain at least 85% Glera Grape to be labeled as Prosecco so many other Proseccos only contain 85% Glera Grape with a mix of cheaper grapes. SYLTBAR uses 100% Glera Grape.Many sparkling Rosés have a Pinot Noir Grape blend. SYLTBAR uses 100% Merlot what is very seldom because Merlot has less acidity. A Sparkling Rosé never can be a Prosecco.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 style="color:#a4905e;">What difference does a 4-month fermentation process make?</h3>
            <p>The secondary fermentation process for SYLTBAR Sparkling Wine products takes up to 4 months, which is the optimal amount of time to ensure only fruit sugars are left. The end result is a naturally produced Prosecco and Sparkling Rosé that has no added sugars and no added sulfites. <br><br> There are only 1.5 grams of Carbs in a 6 oz glass (compared to an average of 5 grams) and 66ppm Sulfites in a 6 oz glass (compared to an average of 140ppm).</p>

If the order has not been retrieved within those 5 days, then the package will be returned to us and you will be responsible for any additional delivery charges. We strongly recommend using a business address for your delivery as this may facilitate delivery because someone 21 years of age or older must be present to sign for the order delivery.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3 style="color:#a4905e;">Why was my package returned to the shipper?</h3>
            <p>Packages that are damaged in shipment will be returned to the shipper. When this happens, we will send out a new shipment containing the item(s) ordered and you will not be charged for this additional shipment.<br><br>Packages can also be returned to the shipper for other reasons which will incur additional charges or affect the refund amount if the package is restocked. When a package is returned to the shipper because the address was entered incorrectly, a refund will be issued to the credit card used to make the original payment, less the cost of shipping to the original destination as well as back to the shipper. The amount deducted from your refund will be based on the original method of shipping chosen. For example, if the shipping charge is $15.00, the amount refunded will be less $30.00. An additional charge can occur if the cost of the product is less than the total amount of shipping fees. This same refund/fee structure will also apply to packages that are returned to the shipper because the recipient had this held at a local FedEx office and failed to collect the package in time or if delivery was not made after 3 attempts by FedEx. If the package is not restocked, but is reshipped, their will be an additional charge to reship the product and a charge for the return shipment as well as the new shipment out will be made against the purchaser's credit card. <br><br>Due to the personal nature of engraved products, these items are non-refundable. We will contact the purchaser of the engraved gift and arrange to have this reshipped. Again, the fee charged for this reshipment will include the cost of the new shipment as well as the cost of the shipment back to our retail partner.</p>
