<h3>University of Miami Diabetes Research Institute</h3>
<p>Working with the University of Miami Diabetes Research Institute, we tested both SYLTBAR Premium Prosecco and SYLTBAR Sparkling Rose against our competitors. Dr. Ricordi compared the glucose levels of all the sparkling wines to see how much of the "wine" was actually sugar. <a href="https://docs.google.com/gview?url=http://www.syltbar.com/product_images/uploaded_images/Diabetes%20Letter.pdf&amp;embedded=true" target="_blank">Read more about the research and results here. </a></p>
<h3>Double Fermentation, No Sugar Added</h3>
<p>It should be no surprise that both SYLTBAR Premium Prosecco and SYLTBAR Sparkling Rose have low amounts of sugar. It's because we don't add any! So how is it still delicious without any sugar? Our fermentation process takes fours months because it is double fermented. This extra time allows the 100% glera or merlot grapes to fully develop their flavor.</p>
