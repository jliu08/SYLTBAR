<h2>Don&rsquo;t be a snob too prefer a good Prosecco to Champagne</h2>
<p>There are excellent Prosecco&rsquo;s from Italy which rival the best Champagnes, and are better the mediocre ones. A
    true wine-lover should never be hung up on names and labels.</p>
<h2>Sparkling Wine is the most versatile food pairing wine</h2>
<p>Many people tend to reserve Sparkling Wine for special occasions, when we really should be having it all year round.
    Start popping SYLTBAR bottles like a pro, all 365 days of the year. <br />Master Sommeliers have no hesitation in
    picking a bubbly to enjoy during a dinner, because what food doesn&rsquo;t taste better with a squeeze of lime on
    it? A good Sparkling Wine, that is also acidic, offers a nice complement to anything from tuna tartar to Beef
    Bourguignon.</p>
<h2>Is Sparkling Wine in splits and half bottles full worth it?</h2>
<p>No, the fact is that sparkling Wine in little bottles age faster, due to a greater ratio of air to wine. That is why
    SYLTBAR doesn&rsquo;t offer little-sized bottles.</p>
<h2>It is not Champagne unless it comes from Champagne, FR.</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t call Sparkling Wine from California or Australia (however wonderful it may be), "Champagne". The same
    with Prosecco. In short, Prosecco comes from Northern Italy and Cava comes from Spain.</p>
<h2>Don&rsquo;t allow the cork to pop loudly.</h2>
<p>Remove the foil and the wire, hold the cork and gently twist the bottle (not the cork) allowing it to release with a
    muted thud that says &lsquo;I am a person of the world&rsquo;, not a loud explosion that says &lsquo;I learned all
    I know about Champagne from the scene in Dumb, Dumber where they got rid of an endangered species with an exploding
    cork.&rsquo;</p>
<h2>Putting ice Cubes in Champagne or Prosecco is just trendy.</h2>
<p>Just remember - trendy and tasteful are not the same thing. It hurts of what ice will do to the delicate aromas of
    fine Champagne, Prosecco or Sparkling Wine. But if you think this sounds like a smashing good time, you probably
    aren&rsquo;t drinking if for the delicate aromas.</p>
<h2>Older is NOT always better, especially for Prosecco marked Non Vintage.</h2>
<p>When it comes to wine, this might be true. But this is not the case for Champagne and Prosecco marked Non Vintage.
    Non Vintage Prosecco should not be older than a year, to keep the crisp and freshness.</p>
<h2>What type of glass should you serve Sparkling Wine in?</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Champagne flutes are not the best for properly enjoying sparkling wines and their
    aromas. Try putting in a white wine glass or one designed to work with Champagne&rsquo;s chemical and aromatic
    compositions, such as the <a href="http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/235056" target="_blank">Riedel Veritas
        Champagne glass.</a> You do this so that the juice that has been imprisoned will have some space to breathe.
    Try it next time, it makes a big difference.</p>
<h2>Stay away from Mimosa&rsquo;s - unless you make it yourself!</h2>
<p>In restaurants, it&rsquo;s tempting not to enjoy a Mimosa during brunch. But restaurants need to make margins so
    their Mimosas are usually mixed from the cheapest sparkling wine and the orange juice. Headache guaranteed -
    don&rsquo;t say we didn&rsquo;t warn you. <br /> A good Mimosa has to have a high quality of Sparkling Wine and
    should be always mixed up with freshly squeezed orange juice.</p>
<h2>IS a DOCG Prosecco is a better Prosecco than the DOC?</h2>
<p>No, DOC (Denominazione di Origine Controllata ) and DOCG (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita) are 2
    core standards of the designation for wine. They determine the location the wine was produced, not the quality.</p>
