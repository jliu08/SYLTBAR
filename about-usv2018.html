            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Our dream came true eight years ago and today it is not only a dream any more. It is so much more. </p>
            <p>Today we share our story.</p>
            <p>It started twenty years ago when I visited Miami for the first time. It was love at first sight: the weather and climate, ocean, international mix of cultures and people, beautiful palm trees, and amazing hospitality. Since my first visit in Miami in 1998, I came back to Miami almost twice every year. It became my dream to live in Miami one day.</p>
            <h3>My wish came true when I met my husband Claus in Hamburg in 2005. </h3>

            <p>Claus was born in Hamburg and because of his golfing talent he represented the National Golf Team of Germany in different countries. This offered him the opportunity to explore numerous beautiful, high-end hotels and restaurants worldwide. Besides his talent for different sports, Claus managed and represented brands such as FILA, Fruit of the Loom, and Sony Classical. Sony opened the world of music and wines to him, both are still his passion today.</p>
            <h4>We shared our love of the Italian kitchen and their Ars Vivendi. So it was not a big surprise that we married in Italy in 2008.</h4>
            <p>After spending our honeymoon in Miami, we tasted the first Prosecco available in the US Market almost 10 years ago. Due to our 25 years of traveling experience to Italy, we knew  Prosecco quality is available there. With all our respect, we were very disappointed with the quality level of Prosecco available in the US market at the time and we still are.</p>
            <p>We visited major cities like Miami, LA, New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Washington DC, but could not discover a Prosecco on the same level of quality we were used to in Germany, Italy or other European countries. There was not one product which we really liked and enjoyed. Instead we discovered a harsh aftertaste, the product was not naturally produced, the packaging was not really appealing or it just was bitter, too sweet, not light or refreshing.</p>

                <p>We started visiting our favorite Prosecco producer San Simone in Friuli, Italy. My husband and I tasted our favorite Prosecco apart from each other 25 years ago on the island of SYLT located in the North Sea of Germany, very close to the Danish border.</p>
                <p>SYLT is a very famous German island and the hot spot for the Germans which can be compared to the American Hamptons or Nantucket. The logo which you find on all SYLTBAR products is the shape of the island SYLT as it’s bar sets the standards for extraordinary quality. This is what we have trademarked in the US market. SYLT is one of the destinations in the famous book titled <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/1000-places-to-see-before-you-die-2nd-edition-patricia-schultz/1107838608/2678940647470?st=PLA&sid=BNB_DRS_New+Marketplace+Shopping+Textbooks_00000000&2sid=Google_&sourceId=PLGoP164984&gclid=Cj0KCQiA2snUBRDfARIsAIGfpqHjdd9kHyTZpDz8vqRzH1LxBmC-yxx9jR3rp9R585xyGzwOWwmSne4aAtEBEALw_wcB" target="_blank">“1000 places to see before you die”.</a></p>

            <p>After having tasted hundred kinds of Prosecco we both believed that San Simone offers by far the best quality. Today we know many more reasons why we came to that conclusion. Five years ago the <a href="http://www.syltbar.com/compare-syltbar/">Diabetes Research Institute at the University of Miami</a> tested 80 Sparkling wines including Champagne, Prosecco, Cava and found out that SYLTBAR Premium Prosecco had the lowest sugar content. This is caused mainly by a secondary fermentation process which reduces the sugar level dramatically. We are convinced that everything our body consumes should be naturally produced which causes a positive impact to all of us. It is for a matter of fact that our tongue and body do not lie related to what it has been exposed to.</p>
            <h4>SYLTBAR products ensure that it has been produced with responsibility, love, patience and passion inside and out.</h4>
            <p>It was and still is a tough, challenging journey for us and a big adventure. It has not always been fun because we had to deal with lots of uncertainties which included working day and night, a real hustle, sacrifices to put 100% of our time and energy into SYLTBAR. We believed in it and could see the progress which makes it all worth it. </p>
